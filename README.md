I approach software development by first picturing what the software needs to achieve, then imagining what the user could do with it, and finally considering what additional functionalities could enhance the overall experience. I focus on creating modular, reusable, maintainable, and secure code.

This project helped me develop a more creative approach to code development. Even though the requirements were very specific, the assignment still gave me enough freedom to make decisions I believed were best for the scene and the workflow.

The design process I followed was very linear, since I was essentially working through each week’s assignment at the pace I learned new techniques. After learning and somewhat mastering most of the core concepts—lighting, texture application, object merging—around week five I went all in and applied everything I had learned up to that point to complete the scene. I also took advice from a fellow classmate to polish some of my lighting decisions.

Iteration was central to my workflow. Every week, as I incremented the program, I had to re‑run it, move objects around so they wouldn’t collide with others, or shift them off‑center so I could focus on different aspects of the scene. I constantly turned lights on and off, hid objects, added placeholders, used temporary textures, and adjusted light intensity up or down depending on what I was testing. All of these small cycles of change and refinement helped me reach the final product.

From the beginning, I pictured what I wanted the code to do—mainly, just to work—but as I learned more and got the core functionality running, I started adding small enhancements. I added a picture of my front wall to simulate my workstation background, applied my actual wallpaper to the monitor, and included other small details to increase the realism of the scene. These additions came naturally as my understanding of the tools improved.

I expect to keep polishing the techniques I acquired in this course, along with those I developed and am still perfecting from previous classes. Agile has been the bedrock of my work since I learned it a few semesters ago, and every day I find it more relevant. Hopefully, once I enter the job market, I can put this framework to its best use.
